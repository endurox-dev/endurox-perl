The documentation on the Endurox perl module can be viewed 
by running perdoc Endurox.pm.

To build the Endurox module, you must have 

- Endurox7.1 or later must be installed.  All my build tests have been
  with Endurox8.0 and Endurox8.1.

- a valid endurox development license should be in $NDRX_HOME/udataobj

- $NDRX_HOME must set in your environment

- $NDRX_HOME/bin must be in your PATH environment variable

- The same compiler used to build perl must also be in your PATH

- It is also recommended that LANG be set to C, but this is not mandatory.

The steps to build the module are...

1/ perl Makefile.pl

2/ make test

3/ make install
