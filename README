The documentation on the Tuxedo perl module can be viewed 
by running perdoc Tuxedo.pm.

To build the Tuxedo module, you must have 

- Tuxedo7.1 or later must be installed.  All my build tests have been
  with Tuxedo8.0 and Tuxedo8.1.

- a valid tuxedo development license should be in $TUXDIR/udataobj

- $TUXDIR must set in your environment

- $TUXDIR/bin must be in your PATH environment variable

- The same compiler used to build perl must also be in your PATH

- It is also recommended that LANG be set to C, but this is not mandatory.

The steps to build the module are...

1/ perl Makefile.pl

2/ make test

3/ make install
